        <p>Hi my name is <b>Marie.</b> I was born in Paris but raised in Santa Cruz, California. I decided to move back to Paris only a few years ago to re-connect with my french roots. I've always been a creative at heart but didn't quite figure out how to channel my creativity until I started coding. What really interests me facilitating user experiences through the application of design. I'm constantly seeking to learn more, to experience more, and to apply more code in my every day life.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, I have to take a break from coding. When that occurs I enjoy painting watercolor cards, shooting film photography for friends but also on occasion for musicians, and tending to the numerous plants I have accumulated over the years. As well as taking my 3 year old pug on walks. </p>
